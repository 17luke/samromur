While language technology for Icelandic has made great strides in recent years, many speech recognition systems still struggle with Icelandic spoken by those who learned it as a second language. Everyone is encouraged to take part! Whether your Icelandic is excellent or you've recently started learning, the goal of this collection is to cover all kinds of Icelandic."
