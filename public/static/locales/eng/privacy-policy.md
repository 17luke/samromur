Depending on the circumstances, RU may also process personal information based on your consent, cf. 1. tl.1. mgr. Article 9 the Privacy Act, e.g. if you subscribe to our mailing list.

Language technology aims to develop solutions that can work with and understand languages ​​and promotes their use in human-computer communication. RU wants to promote public awareness of the Icelandic voice database Samrómur in order to support and strengthen parties working on the development of Icelandic language technology solutions.

The database is an important step in securing the future of the Icelandic language and thus our culture. It is necessary to ensure that Icelandic is on an equal footing with other languages ​​in an ever-changing and fast-paced world of technology, and that as many opportunities as possible are taken to use language technology in modern society.

To facilitate the creation of a complete voice database, participants are given the option of providing information on age, gender and mother tongue. This information improves the quality of the voice database and is part of ensuring that the database represents as many groups in society as possible.

RU contributes to ensuring that Icelandic is not lost by making an Icelandic voice database that is constantly evolving and accessible to everyone for an unlimited period of time. Voice recording and information will only be used to create knowledge in this important area. The project is carried out in the public interest so that the future sounds good in Icelandic.
