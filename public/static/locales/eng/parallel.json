Parallel Collection for Pronunciation Research) is a language technology project where we are collecting audio recordings from people who speak Icelandic as a second language and also from people whose native language is Icelandic. These audio recordings will be used to create a dataset for research and for the development of language technology tools. Participants read sentences under the section Samhliða safn til framburðarannsókna on Samrómur and answer a few questions about their age, gender and language knowledge in a Google Forms document. "
