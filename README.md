### *Setup*
* Create and populate **config.json** and **database.json**. Structure can be found in their corresponding sample versions. Setting up the e-mail server is optional while developing.
### *Development*
* PWA support is disabled in development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### *Production*
* The start command injects *NODE_ENV=production* on the fly and there is a separate command for starting on Windows because of a slightly different syntax doing that.
```
npm run build

npm run start | npm run start:windows
```
